# Cothority

The code in this repository permits the testing and running of a cothority-system together with some applications. It is split up in deployment, application and protocols. The basic cryptographic code comes from [DeDiS/crypto](https://github.com/DeDiS/crypto).

## Warning
**The software provided in this repository is highly experimental and under heavy development. Do not use it for anything security-critical. All usage is at your own risk!**

## Deploy

* Available:
    * [DeterLab](deterlab.net)
    * Localhost
* Planned:
    * Docker
    * LXC

## Applications

* Available:
    * Timestamping
    * Signing
    * Shamir-secret-service: regular or tree signing
* Planned:
	* Randhound: decentrailzed randomness cothority
    * Vote

## Protocols

* Collective signing

# How to Run a Cothority

All applications in `app/*` are stand-alone. Currently, they can be used by deploying to either localhost or DeterLab.

## Localhost
To run a simple signing check on localhost, execute the following commands:

```
$ go get ./...
$ cd deploy
$ go build
$ ./deploy -deploy localhost simulation/sign_single.toml
```

## DeterLab

If you use the `-deploy deterlab` option, then you are prompted to enter the name of the DeterLab installation, your username, and the names of project and experiment. There are some flags which make your life as a cothority developer simpler when deploying to DeterLab:

* `-nobuild`: don't build any of the helpers which is useful if you're working on the main code
* `-build "helper1,helper2"`: only build the helpers, separated by a ",", which speeds up recompiling
* `-range start:end`: runs only the simulation-lines including `start` and `end`. Counts from 0, start and end can be omitted and represent beginning and end of lines, respectively.

### SSH-keys
For convenience, we recommend that you upload a public SSH-key to the DeterLab site. If your SSH-key is protected through a passphrase (which should be the case for security reasons!) we further recommend that you add your private key to your SSH-agent / keychain. Afterwards you only need to unlock your SSH-agent / keychain once (per session) and can access all your stored keys without typing the passphrase each time.

**OSX:**

You can store your SSH-key directly in the OSX-keychain by executing:

```
$ /usr/bin/ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/<your private ssh key>
```

Make sure that you actually use the `ssh-add` program that comes with your OSX installation, since those installed through [homebrew](http://brew.sh/), [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) etc. **do not support** the `-K` flag per default.

**Linux:**

Make sure that the `ssh-agent` is running. Afterwards you can add your SSH-key via:

```
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/<your private ssh key>
```



# Applications

## CoNode

You can find more information about CoNode in the corresponding [README](https://github.com/DeDiS/cothority/blob/development/app/conode/README.md).

## Timestamping

Sets up servers that listen for client-requests, collects all requests and hands them to a root-node for timestamping.

## Signing

A simple mechanism that is capable of receiving messages and returning their signatures.

## RandHound

Test-implementation of a randomization-protocol based on cothority.

# Protocols

We want to compare different protocols for signing and timestamping uses.

## Collective Signing

This one runs well and is described in a pre-print from Dylan Visher.

## Shamir Signing

A textbook shamir signing for baseline-comparison against the collective signing protocol.
